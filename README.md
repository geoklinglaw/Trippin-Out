# Trippin-Out
Motivation 

Given the recent revival of tourism after Covid-19, the number of people travelling has skyrocketed. Nonetheless, planning a trip can be quite time-consuming and tedious, especially for those who are not well-versed with the destination. As travel enthusiasts, we believe that developing a travel planner would help improve travellers' travel experiences. Our innovative platform aims to simplify the travel planning process by utilising an algorithm that generates personalised travel itineraries based on users' preferences, eliminating the need for extensive research and saving time.

In the current context as university students, we relish the idea of embarking on a group trip with our companions. However, given the busy schedules of each individual and the potential hesitance of some to articulate their travel preferences, it is challenging to come to a common consensus. To mitigate this, we are inspired to develop a travel planner where users are able to customize their own itinerary based on their preferences. This innovative tool can be particularly advantageous for groups of friends voyaging abroad, as it enables us to curate an itinerary that caters to the preferences of all members involved.


Aim 

We hope to make a user-friendly website that generates travel itineraries based on the user’s preferences, making travel planning fuss-free. 

User Stories

As a first-time tourist, I am able to obtain suggestions on possible travel itineraries customised to my interest and preferences.

As a spontaneous tourist, I want to be able to easily adjust my itinerary based on my changing preferences or unexpected circumstances.

As a lazy tourist, I want to travel spontaneously without having to plan much.

As a tourist with the intention to visit many tourist destinations, I want to know how to most efficiently allocate my time to visit as many destinations as possible.


As a frequent traveler, I want a travel planner that can help me keep track of my travel history, my favorite destinations, and my upcoming trips.


As a group of friends who are indecisive, we want to have an itinerary that can please everyone, but it can be hard to coordinate and plan things out as a group.

By addressing these user stories, we hope to provide a comprehensive travel planner that caters to the needs of the various types of travellers, making travel planning easy, efficient, and enjoyable.
